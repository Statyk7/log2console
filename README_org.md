* Multiple Receiver suppport (since v1.1).
* Windows 7 support: Taskbar icons (pause, disable autoscroll, clear all) and Taskbar progress (when messages are received).
* Requires .NET Framework 2.0 only.

## Receivers
* File (Standard log or using log4j xml format)
* UDP IP v4 and v6 (Provides compatibility with log4j and [NLog](docs/NLog.md))
